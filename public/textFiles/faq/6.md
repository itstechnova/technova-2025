# Do I need coding experience?

Not at all! This hackathon is perfect for beginners - no prior coding experience is needed. Hackers have many roles including project management and prototyping! Your team will need people to help ideate, design, and pitch your hack in order to bring it to life, so your unique skills will definitely be an asset.
